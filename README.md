greentextify
============
If you're not a nerd and you want to download this shitty chrome extension then follow these simple steps!
1. Download greentextify.crx
2. Go to chrome://extensions and check the Developer Mode box on the top right
3. Drag the crx folder into the extensions page
4. Kill yourself for using this garbage (do it ironically if you wanted to use this ironically)

If you are a nerd then I can't help you out.
