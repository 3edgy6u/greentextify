greentextify
============
If you're not a nerd and you want to download this garbage chrome extension, you should probably get it from the [chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/greentextify/hjcfkfbfobmejkjkiecbndbmjhabofbk). Otherwise, here is how to do it locally: 

1. Download (greentextify.crx)[https://github.com/3edgy6u/greentextify/releases].
2. Go to chrome://extensions and check the Developer Mode box on the top right
3. Drag the crx folder into the extensions page
4. Cry
